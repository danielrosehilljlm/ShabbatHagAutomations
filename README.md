# Automations for שבת and חגים (Shabbat and Chagim) for the Linux Desktop

- By Daniel Rosehill (danielrosehill.co.il)

This repository will contain Bash scripts suitable for execution on any Linux-based desktop.

These scripts are designed to automatically manipulate the computer and simulate moues clicks in order to perform actions such as opening a Netflix seies, selecting a user profile, making the video stream full screen, and setting the volume (for instance).

Please refer to the halachic note contained in the Wiki — the author does not endorse the practice of using Bash scripts during Shabbat and Chagim and points out that according to the majority of opinions the use of such scripts would violate the melacha of uvdin b'hol.
